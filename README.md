# PSU IST256.001- Final Project
By Eric Nguyen <br>

Website was made from scratch, no template was used, only documentation from Bootstrap, jQuery, Masonry, and NYT API. 
* 18 April 2023- Rough Draft Copy Uploaded <br>
* 22 April 2023- Final Copy Uploaded

# Notes
* Product/Shop page uses masonry to organize product cards, but because masonry and the cards load faster than the images, sometimes the page cards will overlap each other. Best way is to resize the page in order for Bootstrap Masonry to reorganize the cards. 
* JSON data is pulled from the NYT API Article Search feature, and uses the keyword, 'music', in its request URL. This returns music articles that populate in the Bootstrap Carousel on the product page. 
* Multiple client-side features are implemented such as onhover on buttons, icons, etc. 
* Customers can submit a contact form via the phone button on the top right of the webpages. 
* Font awesome icons & Bootstrap are used in this project.
